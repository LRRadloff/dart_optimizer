# dart_optimizer
This repository contains the code for a small `R Shiny` App I created. It enables you to figure out which point to target when playing darts and is available at

https://lradloff.shinyapps.io/dart_optimizer/

All assumptions and how it works are described within the app itself. The `.csv`-file containing the simulation results is not included in the repo due to storage limitations. The code for generating these simulations is in Dart_Optimizer_Prep, while Dart_Optimizer contains the code for the app itself.
